What requirements did you achieve?
for this project i created a somewhat responsive gallery website with 3 images on it.
to accomplish this I made it so that the displayed large image shrinks and the screen size decreases and the thumbnail display bar flips to the bottom of the screen where it would be easier to access while on a phone.
in order to get the thumbnail bar to be positioned correctly in but desktop and phone view i had to use a media queary so that the flip form the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen functioned.

I also took into consideration the alt text for the images and input what I felt was an appropriatly discriptive alt tag, in order to check this I used the lighthouse feature from the console in chrome which provided me with a 100 score in the accessibility.

while i believe that I have met the requirements of the assignment I found myself sruggling with the css more then I thought I would and I also had a lot of difficulty with getting the create thumbnail function to work as intended as a result I found my self going to google and youtube a lot looking for guides.

How ever after taking a break and going through the functions and loops again
and reading more on mdn I managed to get it working however this has confirmed for me that I need to do more extra study on those topics outside of the lessons to ensure I don't stuggle as much in future projects.
